#Building Library App in 3 hours

While building this project, firstly i started by planning the flow of the project and then deciding the tech stack.
The requirements were provided and it was a huge task to complete in 3 hours.

To run the project firstly

install all requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

Next run the project

Python app.py

I would suggest you to create a virtual environment as the dependencies must not conflict with global versions.

You can try sign up/login
Add books, return books

Please Add your feedback for this project that would really help me to take this project to new heights!

Thankyou for reading!
